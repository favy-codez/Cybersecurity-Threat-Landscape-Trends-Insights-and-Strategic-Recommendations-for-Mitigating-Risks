![Dashboard Preview](https://github.com/favy-codez/Cybersecurity-Threat-Landscape-Trends-Insights-and-Strategic-Recommendations-for-Mitigating-Risks/blob/main/Screenshot%20(594).png)

## Objectives
This dashboard presents a comprehensive overview of global cyber threats between 2015 and 2024. It tracks the frequency, origin, and impact of cyberattacks across various countries and industries, analyzing attack types, vulnerabilities, defense mechanisms, and outcomes. The data sheds light on evolving cybercrime tactics and helps stakeholders understand which areas are most vulnerable. These insights are crucial for designing adaptive and robust cybersecurity strategies, minimizing risk, and safeguarding critical digital infrastructure.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel** â€” For data cleaning, pivot analysis, dashboards, and charts.
- **Kaggle** â€” Source of raw dataset.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Collection** - This dashboard presents a comprehensive overview of global cyber threats between 2015 and 2024. It tracks the frequency, origin, and impact of cyberattacks across various countries and industries, analyzing attack types, vulnerabilities, defense mechanisms, and outcomes. The data sheds light on evolving cybercrime tactics and helps stakeholders understand which areas are most vulnerable. These insights are crucial for designing adaptive and robust cybersecurity strategies, minimizing risk, and safeguarding critical digital infrastructure
2. **Pre-Analysis Planning**
    - Categorized variables as dependent (e.g., financial loss, resolution time) and independent (e.g., attack type, country, industry)
    - Outlined key questions to drive the analysis and structured pivot tables accordingly
3. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Converted dataset into an Excel Table for structured analysis
   - Removed duplicates and fixed inconsistencies in spelling and formatting
   - Filled in missing values where appropriate and standardized key columns (e.g., country names, attack types)
4. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   - Used Excel Pivot Tables to summarize data
   - Grouped and filtered results by country, year, and industry
   - Identified frequency of attack types, sources, and defense methods
5. **Visualization**  
   - Created bar, pie, and line charts  
   - Designed a comprehensive dashboard summarizing all key metrics

### Key Insights:
- The analysis shows that cybercrime incidents are not consistently rising or falling but fluctuate year to year, with the highest number of cases occurring in 2017 and the lowest in 2019.
- Countries like the UK, Brazil, and India experienced the highest volume of attacks, which may correlate with their expanding digital infrastructure.
- Zero-day vulnerabilities and social engineering attacks result in the most significant financial losses, revealing the effectiveness and stealth of these strategies.
- Unpatched software and weak passwords also contribute heavily to monetary losses, indicating persistent gaps in basic cybersecurity hygiene.
- Phishing and DDoS attacks are among the most frequent globally, suggesting that users and systems remain highly susceptible to these entry-level threats.
- Nation-state attacks impacted the highest number of users, followed closely by insider threats and unknown sources, indicating a mix of external and internal vulnerabilities.
- The IT industry emerged as the most affected sector in terms of user exposure, while healthcare, retail, and education were not far behind â€” sectors known to possess large datasets and, often, weaker cybersecurity postures.
